/**
 * Register the annotated type as a GObject signal on the enclosing class.
 * <p>
 * The signal declaration must be a functional interface. Example usage:
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * 
 * public class Example extends GObject {
 *     @Signal
 *     public interface ExampleSignal {
 *         public boolean run();
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * Alternatively, extend an existing functional interface:
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * 
 * public class Example extends GObject {
 *     @Signal
 *     public interface ExampleSignal extends BooleanSupplier {};
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * When the enclosing class is registered as a GObject using
 * {@code Types#register()}, the signal will be registered for that class, using
 * the parameters of the annotated type.
 * <p>
 * The default name of the signal is derived from the type name, translating
 * camel-case ("ExampleSignal") to kebab-case ("example-signal"). It is possible
 * to override this with the {@link #name()} parameter.
