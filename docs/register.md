# Registering new types

## Registration

When you extend a Java class from an existing GObject-derived class, Java will treat it as a subclass of GObject:

=== "Java"

    ```java
    public class MyObject extends GObject {
    }
    ```

=== "Kotlin"

    ```kotlin
    class MyObject : GObject() {
    }
    ```

To make sure that the GObject type system will also recognize it as its own class, Java-GI registers your class as a new GType. It will use reflection to determine the name, parent class, implemented interfaces and overridden methods.

GType registration is supported for classes, interfaces and enums, when the following conditions are met:

* Classes must extend {{ javadoc('GObject') }} or a descendant class.
* Interfaces must extend the Java-GI {{ javadoc('Proxy') }} interface.
* Enums are just enums. To register a flags (bitfield) type, add the `@Flags` annotation.

!!! info
    GObject interfaces don't inherit from other interfaces, but they do allow instead to specify *prerequisite* interfaces and classes. When registering a GType for a Java interface, all GTypeInterfaces that the interface extends from are automatically registered as prerequisites. GObject is automatically added as a prerequisite class, unless you specify another class with the `@Prerequisite` annotation.

!!! info
    With a flags type, the values will represent individual bits in a bitfield, that are powers of two (1, 2, 4, 8, etc.), so they can be combined using bitwise operations to represent multiple flags simultaneously. Without the `@Flags` annotation, the values will have the ordinal enum values, and cannot be bitwise combined.

When instantiating a new Java instance of the class, the call to `super()` will create the native object instance first.

!!! info
    In Java-GI version 0.11.* and below, the GType must be explicitly registered with a call to `Types.register(classname.class)`, and the constructor must be a static factory method. Since Java-GI 0.12.0, this is not necessary anymore.

If your Java application is module-based, you must export your package to the `org.gnome.gobject` module in your `module-info.java` file, to allow the reflection to work:

```
module my.module.name {
    exports my.package.name to org.gnome.gobject;
}
```

### Classes constructed from native code

When your class is constructed by native code (for example, when your Java class is used in a GtkBuilder UI file), you need to add a few more things.

First, explicitly register your class, for example in the main method:

=== "Java"

    ```java
    Types.register(MyObject.class);
    ```

=== "Kotlin"

    ```kotlin
    Types.register(MyObject::class.java)
    ```

You also need to add a memory-address-constructor for Java-GI Proxy objects:

=== "Java"

    ```java
    public MyObject(MemorySegment address) {
        super(address);
    }
    ```

=== "Kotlin"

    ```kotlin
    constructor(address: MemorySegment?) : super(address)
    ```

Ignore warnings that the constructor appears unused: This constructor enables a Java object to be instantiated automatically for GObject instances returned from native function calls.

## Specifying the name of the GType

A GType has a unique name, like 'GtkLabel', 'GstObject' or 'GListModel'. (You can query the name of a GType using `GObjects.typeName()`). When a Java class is registered as a GType, the package and class name are used to generate a unique GType name. You can override this with a specific name using the `@RegisteredType` attribute:

=== "Java"

    ```java
    @RegisteredType(name="MyExampleObject")
    public class MyObject extends GObject {
    }
    ```

=== "Kotlin"

    ```kotlin
    @RegisteredType(name="MyExampleObject")
    class MyObject : GObject {
    }
    ```

To prefix all type names in a package with a shared namespace identifier, use the `@Namespace(name="...")` annotation in your `package-info.java` file.

If you don't intend to override the name of the GType, you can safely omit the `@RegisteredType` and `@Namespace` annotations.

## Method overrides

When you override virtual methods from parent GObject classes (or implemented interfaces), the override will automatically be registered by Java-GI. You don't need to do this manually.

### Chaining up

From inside the method body of an overridden method that is also available as a regular instance method, you cannot call `super.method()` to "chain up" to a parent (native GObject) virtual method, because Java-GI would invoke the instance method. The instance method would in many cases defer to the virtual function pointer of the derived class, resulting in an endless loop. To work around this problem, instead of `super`, call the `asParent()` method that is available on all GObject classes. So instead of `super.method()`, call `asParent().method()` to "chain up".

When a virtual method is not available as a regular instance method, you can safely use `super.method()` to "chain up". These virtual methods are easily recognizable, because they have `protected` visibility.

## Properties

When your class contains getter and setter method pairs, Java-GI will register them as GObject properties. For boolean properties, you can also use `isFoo()`/`setFoo()` pairs. Kotlin creates get- and set-methods for Kotlin properties automatically, so in practice a Kotlin property will be registered as a GObject property.

You can define GObject properties with the `@Property` annotation on other methods besides getter/setter pairs, or when you want to change the property name or change other parameters. When you use `@Property`, you must annotate both the getter and setter methods (if applicable).

Example definition of an `int` property with name `n-items`:

=== "Java"

    ```java
    private int size = 0;

    public int getNItems() {
        return size;
    }

    public void setNItems(int nItems) {
        size = nItems;
    }
    ```

=== "Kotlin"

    ```kotlin
    var nItems: Int = 0
    ```

### Property annotation

The `@Property` annotation can be used to set a property name and other attributes. It can also be used to mark methods as properties that don't conform to the getter/setter convention. Finally, a `@Property(skip=true)` annotation can be used to prevent getter/setter methods getting registered as a GObject property.

For properties with a getter and setter method, either both or neither methods must be annotated with `@Property` (or else they will not be recognized by Java-GI as a pair). The annotation parameters must be specified on the getter. They can be specified on the setter too, but only the parameters on the getter are actually used.

The `@Property` annotation accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter      | Type      | Default value   |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| name           | String    | inferred        |
| type           | ParamSpec | inferred        |
| readable       | Boolean   | true            |
| writable       | Boolean   | true            |
| construct      | Boolean   | false           |
| constructOnly  | Boolean   | false           |
| explicitNotify | Boolean   | false           |
| deprecated     | Boolean   | false           |
| minimumValue   | String    | type-dependent  |
| maximumValue   | String    | type-dependent  |
| defaultValue   | String    | type-dependent  |
| skip           | Boolean   | false           |

All `@Property` annotation parameters are optional.

When the name is not specified, it will be inferred from the name of the method (provided that the method names follow the `getX()`/`setX(...)` pattern), stripping the "get" or "set" prefix and converting CamelCase to kebab-case. If you do specify a name, it must be present on **both** the getter and setter methods (otherwise Java-GI will create two properties, with different names).

When the type is not specified, it will be inferred from the parameter or return-type of the method. When the type is specified, it must be one of the subclasses of `GParamSpec`. The boolean parameters are `GParamFlags` arguments, and are documented [here](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject/flags.ParamFlags.html).

The `@Property` parameters `minimumValue`, `maximumValue` and `defaultValue` expect String values. They are transformed by Java-GI to the proper type using `Boolean.parseBoolean()`, `Integer.parseInt()` etcetera.  Using these three parameters, you can set the minimum, maximum and default values on the `GParamSpec` of a property that was defined in Java.

* The minimum and maximum values are not enforced by Java-GI, so on the Java side the benefits are negligible. In most cases it is advisable to implement minimum and maximum property values in Java itself.
* The default value is returned by Java-GI for properties that have only a setter method in Java.

When the `skip` parameter is set, the method will *not* be registered as a GObject property.

## Class and instance init functions

To implement a custom class initializer or instance initializer function, use the `@ClassInit` and `@InstanceInit` annotations:

=== "Java"

    ```java
    @ClassInit
    public static void classInit(GObject.ObjectClass typeClass) {
        // Class initialization logic
    }

    @InstanceInit
    public void init() {
        // Instance initialization logic
    }
    ```

=== "Kotlin"

    ```kotlin
    companion object {
        @ClassInit
        fun classInit(typeClass: ObjectClass) {
            // Class initialization logic
        }
    }

    @InstanceInit
    fun init() {
        // Instance initialization logic
    }
    ```

In a similar way, annotate a method with `@InterfaceInit` to register it as an interface initialization function. The method must be static and take the interface class (for example, `File.FileIface`) as a parameter.

## Signals

You can define custom signals in Java classes that extend GObject. For example:

=== "Java"

    ```java
    public class Counter extends GObject {
        // declare a signal
        @Signal
        public interface LimitReached {
            void run(int limit);
        }

        public void count() {
            num++;
            if (num == limit) {
                // emit the signal
                emit("limit-reached", limit);
            }
        }
    }
    ```

=== "Kotlin"

    ```kotlin
    class Counter : GObject {
        // declare a signal
        @Signal
        interface LimitReached {
            fun run(limit: Int)
        }
        
        fun count() {
            num++
            if (num == limit) {
                // emit the signal
                emit("limit-reached", limit)
            }
        }
    }
    ```

The "limit-reached" signal in the example is declared with a functional interface annotated as `@Signal`. The method signature of the functional interface is used to define the signal parameters and return value. The signal name is inferred from the interface (converting CamelCase to kebab-case) but can be overridden.

You can connect to the custom signal, like this:

=== "Java"

    ```java
    counter.connect("limit-reached", (Counter.LimitReached) (limit) -> {
        System.out.println("Limit reached: " + limit);
    });
    ```

=== "Kotlin"

    ```kotlin
    counter.connect("limit-reached") { limit: Int ->
        println("Limit reached: $limit")
    }
    ```

Because the signal declaration is an ordinary functional interface, it is equally valid to extend from a standard functional interface like `Runnable`, `BooleanSupplier`, or any other one, like (in the above example) an `IntConsumer`:

=== "Java"

    ```java
    @Signal
    public interface LimitReached extends IntConsumer {}
    ```

=== "Kotlin"

    ```kotlin
    @Signal
    interface LimitReached : IntConsumer
    ```

It is also possible to set a custom signal name and optional flags in the `@Signal` annotation, for example `@Signal(name="my-signal", detailed=true)` to define a detailed signal.
